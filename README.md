# nmap-Scan-Tool

This script will scan the network specified by the network variable for open ports and vulnerabilities, and save the results to the files ports.txt and vulnerabilities.txt, respectively.

You can customize the script by modifying the network variable to specify a different range of IP addresses to scan, or by adding additional options to the nmap command to modify the way the scan is performed. You can find more information about the available options for nmap in the documentation or by running nmap --help on the command line.

NOTE: You must have nmap installed to use this script.
